# [OneMillionWallets Hackathon](https://www.onemillionwallets.com/)


PRICE WIN : 1000$
PRESS : https://www.covalenthq.com/blog/omw-avalanche-winners-announced/


This multi-chain crypto wallet is a cryptocurrency wallet that uses a code base powered by [Kalium](https://github.com/BananoCoin/kalium_wallet_flutter) and uses [Covalent](https://www.covalenthq.com/) services for reading information on different blockchains.

During this hackathon, my goal was to create a mobile crypto wallet that gathers all my addresses to be able to more easily determine my cryptocurrency bag and their values.
Being mainly a JAVA and web developer I had never had the opportunity to learn Flutter. It is therefore via this Hackathon that I had the motivation to learn Flutter.
